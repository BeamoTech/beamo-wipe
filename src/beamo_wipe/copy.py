Compare the name or model, capacity, and serial or hardware ID with a trusted label or record for the disk you intend to erase. Use Show more in the disk list for technical details where available.

If disks look alike or have the same capacity, compare their serial or hardware ID. Size alone is not enough. If identity is missing, duplicated, or does not match your record, do not guess. Ask someone you trust to help identify the disk.

Technical detail: names such as /dev/sda can change between starts. A USB connection can be an external target or the Beamo boot USB; the connection type alone does not identify a disk. The Beamo boot USB remains protected.

Still unsure? Stop and shut down before checking labels or changing connections. Wait until the computer is fully off. Keep the Beamo boot USB for restarting. Do not disconnect hardware while this session is running.
