# Beamo Wipe — Boot and Hardware Compatibility Matrix

**Current gate (2026-09-27):** Blacksmith GitHub Actions runs the full Linux ISO/QEMU and native Windows checks on each main commit. The signed release workflow is manual and requires its dedicated GCP publishing identity. The older Cloud Build notes below are historical.

**Historical cross-platform verification (2026-09-08):** then-current source checks, the actual
platform boundaries, and outstanding gates are recorded in
[the independent second-pass evidence](evidence/cross-platform-verify-20260908/README.md)
and [the first pass](evidence/cross-platform-20260908/README.md).
The then-used PR gate passed at `1ccac62`, but skipped QEMU; direct full-gate submission
was blocked by Cloud Build bucket access at that time. Current PRs run the full
Blacksmith gate, including QEMU. Evaluate subsequent commits using
their own check results. Historical rows below do not prove current firmware
boot or wipe behavior. Native Windows/macOS runtime and physical acceptance
remain separate requirements. The operator matrix for manufactured media on
named machines is [physical acceptance #111](evidence/physical-acceptance-111/README.md);
every physical cell there is **NOT TESTED**. USB-lab and QEMU rows in this
document are not Tier 3 receipts.

**Desktop-entry development update (2026-09-06):** the release matrix below
records the earlier v0.2.6 configuration. The new launcher, FAT32 USB image,
and signed Debian EFI components are described in
[desktop-entry-design.md](desktop-entry-design.md). Its executed validation
and remaining hardware requirements are recorded separately; older Secure
Boot rows below must not be used as evidence for the new image.

**Secure Boot expectations (2026-09-29, #119):** current physical outcomes
come from [the inspected-chain cases](secure-boot-acceptance.md), including
the exact Q12 image identity. Debian-signed shim/GRUB/kernel can be accepted
without a Beamo firmware key when the actual databases and revocation policy
permit them. Unknown state cannot qualify a Pass. No firmware changes are
prescribed to make a case pass; physical coverage remains NOT TESTED.

Shutdown actions described below now request the shared shutdown decision:
when a report was requested but no current verified export is confirmed,
**Shut down without saving?** requires a separate choice. **Keep session open**
is the safe default. Tk Enter/Escape returns; Tab and Space select an action.
The screen-reader view exposes Keep first and both native buttons. See
[the state, console, and recovery rules](report-shutdown.md). No report survives
live-session shutdown or power loss unless it has been exported.

> **Matrix v1.14 — for Beamo Wipe 0.2.12 (nwipe 0.42)**
> Date: 2026-09-29
> Author: Accountable senior engineer (this checkout)
> Status: Versioned release target. No physical destructives on the developer host. Production evidence requires the exact-source Blacksmith gate and signed release manifest.

Customer-facing startup and compatibility text for **this USB** comes from
`src/beamo_wipe/compat_story.py` and is injected into helper/START-HERE.html
with the image's build identity. This matrix is the operator history and
fixture map. Do not paste its changelog into helper or launcher copy.

This matrix is the versioned answer to the production-readiness gate: *which firmware, boot media, storage, display, and input combinations are supported, degraded, or unsupported, and how we know*.

It does **not** weaken safety gates. Every *Fail Closed* row lists no disks and invokes nothing when identity is uncertain — that is the correct result.

## 1. Safety boundary (applies to every case)

> Full signal map: [`docs/boot-exclusion-signals.md`](boot-exclusion-signals.md) — every lsblk field, mount source, alias, partition, removable flag, and metadata-refresh path that can make boot identity uncertain.

- **Never run nwipe against a real disk from the dev machine.** `./preview` and `pytest` use **fake lsblk JSON only** (`tests/fixtures/*.json`, `src/beamo_wipe/demo_*.json`). No host-disk enumeration.
- **ISO builds and any destructive/QEMU run belong on an isolated x86_64 Linux runner/VM** with no host-disk passthrough and an explicitly created disposable `qcow2`. See `docs/vm-test.md` and `.github/workflows/ci.yml` → `scripts/ci-hosted.sh`.
- **Fail closed:** missing/conflicting/stale/changed boot or target identity → expose **no destructive target** and invoke **nothing** (`DiscoveryResult.boot_identified == False`, `selectable == ()`, `SafetyError`).
- **Invariants never relaxed:** boot-media exclusion, exact whole-disk binding (`/dev/nvme0n1`, not `n1p1`), ownership checkbox, type-to-confirm, 5 s delay, no-auto-start, pinned `nwipe` at `/usr/lib/beamo-wipe/nwipe` (`NWIPE_PINNED_COMMIT 6082bde060091e66365d852a1877f2ee80c67105`), logs under `/tmp/beamo-wipe/` (never target). Any change to these is a `safety:` commit with a test.
- All local and CI paths are asserted with spies/fakes: `tests/test_security_hardening.py`, `tests/test_nwipe_runner.py`, `tests/test_safety.py` — `NwipeRunner.start` raises in preview/dry-run; `discover` never reads real `/proc/self/mountinfo` when a payload is injected.

## 2. Test environments

| Env | Identity | Use | Isolation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Local fake-device** | `Darwin MacBook-Air-7.local 25.5.0 arm64, Python 3.10.0, pytest 9.0.3` | Parser/device-state, wizard state machine, UI layout, safety gates | Fake `lsblk` JSON injection; `BEAMO_WIPE_DRY_RUN=1`; `DryRunRunner`; no subprocess `nwipe` |
| **Blacksmith hosted gate** | `blacksmith-4vcpu-ubuntu-2404` for Linux; native Blacksmith Windows 2025 for launchers | Canonical pytest + amd64 ISO build + isolated KVM QEMU + native Windows | `.github/workflows/ci.yml`; fake local metadata; ISO 9660/size/hash validation; default-ephemeral output; separately authorized signed releases use a unique no-overwrite `gs://beamo-wipe_cloudbuild/releases/<BUILD_ID>/` path |
| **Isolated x86_64 QEMU/KVM** | Per `docs/vm-test.md`: throwaway `n2-standard-4` / `t3.large` with `/dev/kvm`, disposable `qcow2` | Boot the ISO, prove wizard is first UI, wipe disposable disk, confirm success/fail screens | No host-disk passthrough; `qemu-img create -f qcow2 /tmp/beamo-wipe-target.qcow2 10G`; VM torn down after |

Local `python3 -m pytest` is the fast fake-device gate; `tk_runtime` clipped-text checks require Xvfb 72 DPI and are run on the hosted gate. Tk tests scale with DPI — `DISPLAY=:99` @72 DPI or `xvfb-run -a -s "-screen 0 1600x1000x24 -dpi 72"`; VNC `DISPLAY=:1` @96 DPI is not the gate.

Environments map to evidence tiers defined in [`docs/evidence-tiers.md`](evidence-tiers.md): local fake-device is Tier 1 (never boot/wipe/hardware proof), Blacksmith ISO + isolated QEMU is Tier 2 (never physical-hardware proof), named lab machines are Tier 3. Section 4–9 rows marked *Supported* rest on Tier 1 unless §4 of that page links a dated Tier 2/3 receipt for the pinned build; unlinked combinations are explicitly `UNVERIFIED` there.

## 4. Firmware & boot-mode matrix

All ISO boot tests are **QEMU x86_64**; on Apple silicon they are TCG and marked *Pending KVM*. Fixture tests cover the *disk-identification* half on both hosts.

## 5. Boot-media & identification matrix

- `lsblk_multi_mixed.json` — boot USB + 4 targets: `nvme0n1` 256 NVMe, `nvme1n1` 256 NVMe (same size pair), `sda` 1 TB HDD, `sdd` 512 GB SATA SSD (rota false) + `sdc` 16 GB usb stick extra (to test hub scenario); exercises ST-04 and same-size conflict.
- `lsblk_sata_bridge.json` — boot USB behind SATA bridge (`tran sata` for usb stick) + leftover usb with BEAMO_WIPE label, tests BM-05/06 path.

Each fixture has a matching test in `tests/test_compatibility_matrix.py` that asserts `discover()` result, `selectable` set, boot identity, kind/bus, and *fail-closed* where applicable. All fixtures use **fake JSON only**.

## 7. Display & resolution matrix

TkWizard.minsize `800x600`; 1280×720 is a short supported layout. Hero width cap `CONTENT_W 940`. Tests drive Tk at 72 DPI (live USB default X DPI) via `xvfb-run -a -s "-screen 0 1600x1000x24 -dpi 72"` or `DISPLAY=:99` @72 DPI. VNC `:1` @96 DPI is **not** the gate (clips).

| ID | Resolution | Hardware | Expected | Observed | Result |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **DISP-01** | **1024×740** (comfortable) | Old laptop LCD, Intel iGPU (live X modesetting) | All screens fit without clipping; pick list scrolls; primary button visible | `tests/test_tk_runtime.py::test_screen_fits_without_clipping[MIN_WINDOW]` — visits Label/Entry req vs actual, and off-window widget check; both `[]` | **Supported** |
| **DISP-02** | **1280×820** (default) | 13″ laptop, 96→72 DPI X | Same, with more breathing room | `WINDOW` variant passes same tests | **Supported** |
| **DISP-03** | **1280×720 / 1366×768** | 14–15″ 720p laptop | Short compact layout at 720; 768 uses the comfortable tall pads. Footer on-window; body may scroll | `tests/test_layout.py::test_720p_laptop_is_short_supported_layout`; `test_adaptive_layout` at `LAPTOP_SIZE (1280, 720)` | **Supported** |
| **DISP-04** | **1920×1080** (FHD) | External monitor, QXL/VMware driver | Content centered (`CONTENT_W 940`), vertical centering, no stretch; fonts DejaVu | Preview at 1920 width keeps card 940 centered; gallery CSS `max-width:940` | **Supported** |
| **DISP-05** | **800×600** (minimum) | Very old LCD / VM fallback `vga=788` failsafe | Compact layout: body may scroll; identity, warnings, and footer actions stay on-window | `tests/test_adaptive_layout.py` at `MIN_SIZE (800, 600)` | **Supported** |
| **DISP-06** | HiDPI 200% (e.g., 2560×1440 @ 2×) | Modern laptop, X DPI 144 | Tk scales with DPI (Tk 8.6 font scaling); DejaVu at 2× may overflow `WRAP 868`; clipped-text test would fail at 144 DPI | Gate stays at 72 DPI per `.cursor/start.sh`; HiDPI not claimed | **Degraded (untested)** |
| **DISP-07** | Xorg driver probe (no `Driver "vesa"` forced) | UEFI without VBIOS (no VBE) | System must not force VESA on every GPU — must probe modesetting/simpledrm first | `test_xorg_does_not_force_vesa_on_every_gpu` asserts no `Driver "vesa"` and `AllowMouseOpenFail` | **Supported** |

Evidence for DISP-01/02: local Xvfb 72 DPI run (hosted gate); 218-test suite includes 14+ layout tests. DISP-03/04 are linear interpolations of the same `CONTENT_W` + `minsize` design; DISP-05/06 are documented degraded/untested rather than claimed.

Gallery/web-preview shares same tokens (BG, SURFACE, INK, PRIMARY, etc.) — `tests/test_ui_system.py` pins every token appears in `gallery_html()` and `helper/index.html`; `test_text_contrast_meets_wcag_aa` enforces ≥4.5:1 for text and ≥3:1 for focus/border.

---

## 8. Keyboard-only & input matrix

All wizard screens are keyboard-reachable. Tk primary action is **global Enter/KP_Enter on the root**, not per-button Space — gates live there. Buttons activate on Space only to avoid shadowing.

| ID | Path | Keys | Expected | Observed | Result |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **KB-01** | Any → What → Owner → Pick (first Up/Down selects edge) | `any key` on Splash, `Return` on What, `Space` on Owner checkbox, `Up/Down` on Pick | Splash advances on any key; What `Return` → Owner; Space toggles `owner_ok`; first `Down` selects first sorted disk, `Up` selects last when none selected | `test_keyboard_only_flow_reaches_working`, `test_move_selection_*`, `test_every_screen_has_a_focusable_action` | **Supported** |
| **KB-02** | Pick → Confirm → Method → Last chance (countdown) | `Return` on Confirm (token match), digits `1/2/3` on Method, `Return` on Last chance after 5 s | Token mismatch blocks `continue_confirm`; Method `1/2/3` switches method; Last chance `Return` during countdown is ignored | `test_keyboard_only_flow_reaches_working` (countdown guard), `test_move_selection_follows_path_sorted_order` | **Supported** |
| **KB-03** | Held Enter across screen transition | Press `Return` on Method → arrive Last chance with countdown active, keep holding | **Must not** fire Erase when countdown completes while key still down; only after release + fresh press | `test_held_enter_does_not_erase_when_countdown_completes` + `…_does_not_skip_method_after_confirm` + `…_does_not_shutdown_pick_empty/failed_done` | **Supported** |
| **KB-04** | Done / empty / blocked → shutdown | `Return`/`Space` on Done/empty/blocked | First press ignored until `_done_keyboard_armed` after key release; second press shuts down | `test_held_enter_does_not_shutdown_*`, `test_held_space_does_not_shutdown_*`, `test_curses_pick_empty_enter_ignored_until_idle` | **Supported** |
| **KB-05** | Tab / focus ring | Tab cycles primary/secondary/ghost buttons | Every screen has a focusable action (`takefocus=1`, `<FocusIn>`/`<FocusOut>` → focus ring) | `test_button_variants_and_keyboard_activation`, `test_box_component_supports_shadows_and_sync_fit` | **Supported** |
| **KB-06** | Escape → Back | `Esc` on Owner/Pick/Confirm/Method/Last/Advanced | Returns to previous screen, clears `_erase_until` when leaving Last chance | `test_escape_goes_back`, `Wizard.back()` mapping | **Supported** |
| **KB-07** | Console fallback (no X, `curses` or plain `input()`) | `Up/Down` (curses) / numbers (plain), `Space`, `Enter`, `1/2/3`, `YES`, `ERASE` | Plain loop `Number of disk to erase` rejects `0` and non-numeric; curses pick shows serial + path + `SAME_SIZE_HINT`; confirm uses own `getch` loop with `enter_held` guard | `tests/test_console_pick.py` (8 tests) | **Supported** |
| **KB-08** | Pick list with many disks → scroll | Keyboard nav keeps selected card in view | `yview` fraction computed from card `winfo_y` vs canvas `bbox`; visible check `y0 >= top -0.02 and y1 <= bottom+0.02` | `test_pick_list_scrolls_selected_card_into_view`, `test_pick_list_keeps_scroll_position_on_click` | **Supported** |

Hints render as key caps (`Enter`, `Esc`, `Space`, `Up/Down`, `1, 2, or 3`) in both Tk (`_KEY_TOKEN_RE`) and gallery (`renderHint`); pinned by `test_every_hint_key_name_renders_as_a_key_cap`.

---

## 9. Safety-gates matrix

Each gate is pinned by a `SafetyError` + test spy that asserts `NwipeRunner` is **not** invoked when gates fail.

| Gate | Rule | Spy / test | Result |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Owner ack | Checkbox must be checked (`owner_ok` → `assert_ready_to_wipe` raises "Owner checkbox") | `test_owner_and_token_required_before_wipe`, wizard `accept_what`/`continue_owner` | **Supported** |
| Type-to-confirm | Token from `confirm_spec` (size label OR last4 serial OR full serial OR unique hardware ID via `SAFE_TOKEN_RE`), case-insensitive. Kernel names are never tokens; insufficient certainty fails closed. | `test_unique_size_uses_gb_label`, `test_duplicate_size_uses_serial_suffix`, `test_identity.py`, `test_unsafe_serial...`, `test_empty_serial...` | **Supported / fail closed** |
| 5 s delay | `wipe.confirm_erase` checks `erase_enabled == countdown_left<=0`; `tick` counts `COUNTDOWN_S 5.0` | `test_happy_path_dry_run` (5 s then confirm), `test_held_enter_does_not_erase_when...` | **Supported** |
| No auto-start | `Wizard.screen == SPLASH` and `not preview` only advances via `tick` after 3 s *or* explicit `skip_splash`/`any key`; `test_no_autostart_wipe` asserts `runner.started False` | `test_no_autostart_wipe`, `test_splash_times_out`, `test_preview_splash_does_not_auto_advance` | **Supported** |
| Boot exclusion | `assert_boot_excluded` raises if `boot_identified False` or `boot in selectable`; `selectable_disks` returns `()` when `boot_identified False`; `Wizard.select_disk` ignores boot path | `test_boot_never_selectable`, `test_unidentified_boot_raises`, `test_select_disk_refuses_boot_alias` | **Supported** |
| Exact target binding | `normalize_whole_disk` rejects partitions (`sda1`, `nvme0n1p1`), optical (`sr0`), `nbd*`, whitespace/comma; `validate_argv` requires exactly one `/dev` positional last; `block_rdev` + `assert_size_unchanged` re-check before exec | `test_nbd_is_not_a_wipe_target`, `test_optical_is_never_a_wipe_target`, `test_validate_rejects_extra_positional`, etc. | **Supported** |
| Pinned nwipe | `resolve_nwipe_binary` only allows `nwipe` or `NWIPE_PINNED_PATH`; `assert_nwipe_binary_safe` checks ELF magic, root-owned, not writable; `NWIPE_PINNED_VERSION 0.42` line match, not substring | `test_nwipe_binary_is_pinned_path_not_path_lookup`, `test_nwipe_script_is_not_a_safe_engine` | **Supported** |
| Log isolation | `assert_log_not_on_target` + `_log_filesystem_is_target` + `FORBIDDEN_LOG_ROOTS`; `default_log_dir` checks `0o700`, owned, on `/tmp`, symlink refusal | `test_log_*`, `test_truncate_log_does_not_follow_symlink`, `test_log_on_target_mount_is_refused` | **Supported** |

Preview/dry-run cannot exec real `NwipeRunner`: `test_confirm_erase_refuses_real_runner_in_dry_run`, `test_nwipe_runner_does_not_deadlock_on_stdout`, `test_zero_confirm_rdev_is_fail_closed_for_real_engine`.

---

## 10. Honest supported / degraded / unsupported summary

### Supported

- **Firmware:** Legacy BIOS and UEFI (Secure Boot disabled) via `syslinux` + `grub-efi`. Both show the wizard first; power-off via `systemctl poweroff` after Done.
- **USB boot variants:** USB-A and USB-C via adapter when firmware lists the stick; directly attached, not a keyboard hub if avoidable (`docs/boot-card.md`). Optical ISO (`sr0`) as QEMU path.
- **Storage:** NVMe (Samsung 970/980 etc.), SATA HDD (ST500/WDC), SATA SSD (Crucial MX500), virtio `vda` (QEMU), USB-attached disks (`tran usb` SATA bridges). Multi-disk (2–4) with same-size handling via last-4-serial → full serial → device-name token chain.
- **Display:** 800×600 through 1920×1080, including 1280×720, on Xorg `modesetting`/`fbdev`/`qxl`/`vmware`/`amdgpu`/`intel`/`nouveau` + DejaVu fonts, 72 DPI gate.
- **Input:** Full keyboard traversal (Tk and console fallback) with held-key guards; mouse click on disk cards.
- **Boot identification:** Live mount (`/run/live/medium` etc.) + `findmnt` + `mountinfo` + cmdline tokens (`boot=live`/`casper`, `bootfrom`/`live-media`/`img_dev`) + typed sources (`LABEL=/UUID=/PARTUUID=`) + label scan limited to `usb`/`rom`.
- **Safety:** All gates above; `nwipe` never runs with `--force`, never with a device list other than one, always `--exclude=` boot.

### Degraded (works but with limits)

- **SSDs:** Overwrite via `prng`/`dodshort`/`zero` is **not a formal certificate**; controller wear-leveling may retain data (SSD footer on pick screen, `docs/storage-and-controller-limits.md` §3, evidence `warnings[]`). Customers needing certified SSD erasure must use vendor secure-erase tool per model or physical destruction per `docs/storage-and-controller-limits.md` §5.
- **Missing/duplicate metadata:** Falls back to label → `Unknown model`. Same-size disks without a unique serial or hardware ID fail closed: shut down and disconnect extra drives. Kernel names are never identity.
- **eMMC/mmcblk:** `mmcblk0boot0/1/rpmb` (4 MiB) are hidden — correct (they are not wipe targets) the ordinary `mmcblk0` user-data device remains eligible when all disk safety checks pass. Only firmware-area nodes alone yield `PICK_EMPTY`.
- **USB hubs / keyboard hubs:** May hide the stick from firmware boot menu; degraded boot findability (try direct port, disable Fast Boot per `docs/boot-card.md`).
- **HiDPI:** May exhibit clipping at non-gate DPI; not automated at those DPIs. 800×600 and 1280×720 are supported short layouts.
- **Secure Boot enforcing:** Firmware-dependent acceptance of the inspected Debian chain; trust, revocations, SBAT and firmware architecture decide. Use [the physical cases](secure-boot-acceptance.md). Unknown policy cannot Pass. We do not prescribe security changes or ship a bypass.
- **Xorg driverless fallback:** Very old GPUs may fall back to `vesa`/`fbdev` (still works but slower); we deliberately do not force VESA on every GPU.

### Unsupported (honest)

- **Apple Silicon Macs (M1/M2/M3)** — `amd64` ISO only, per `docs/claims.md` and every screen subtitle. Intel Macs *may* show USB in boot picker; not supported.
- **Chromebooks, Android, RAID controllers** (`megaraid`, `aacraid`, `dm-raid` not enumerated), **Apple T2** internal storage via special driver — not listed, not tested, not claimed.
- **Network/remote storage:** `nbd`, `iscsi`, `fc`/`fcoe`, `nvmeof` — hidden via `REMOTE_BUS_TOKENS` + `WHOLE_DISK_RE`; never offered (correct).
- **In-OS wipe from Windows/macOS:** Not a wiper from inside a running OS (`app.require_live_or_dry_run`).
- **Plug-and-play / "any computer" / "military certified"** — forbidden claims per `docs/claims.md`; not advertised.
- **Concurrent wipe of multiple disks** — not offered; one `--autonuke` with one positional target only.
- **QEMU destructive wipe on Apple silicon** — not run here (TCG only); marked *Pending KVM* in this matrix; hosted gate covers build, `docs/vm-test.md` covers disposable VM steps for an operator with x86_64 KVM.

## 11. Backlog findings (numbered, separate from matrix verdicts)

These are historical findings from the original matrix audits, not current
execution instructions. Provider migrations, old version numbers and suggested
commands below describe that audit's state. In particular, BF-001/BF-008's
Cloud Build follow-ups and BF-012's non-blocking lint description are superseded
by [current CI](ci.md): Blacksmith runs blocking lint/types and full PR/main
qualification. Consult the linked current guidance before executing commands.
The original findings remain visible rather than hidden in a pass count.

**BF-001 — Staged chroot drift: `__init__.py` 0.1.0 vs 0.1.1**
Evidence: `tests/test_live_image.py::test_staged_chroot_package_matches_src` failed (byte 129 `0` vs `1`). Root: bump to `0.1.1` in `src/beamo_wipe/__init__.py` not yet copied to `packaging/live/config/includes.chroot/.../beamo_wipe/__init__.py` (bind-mount not live). Fix: `cp src/beamo_wipe/__init__.py packaging/live/.../__init__.py` (done in this change). Remaining: need fresh Cloud Build to produce `dist/beamo-wipe-0.1.1-amd64.iso`.

**BF-002 — Test pollution via `apply_live_session_overrides` `os.environ.pop`**
Evidence: `tests/test_security_hardening.py::test_live_session_strips_web_and_helper` left `BEAMO_WIPE_DRY_RUN` unset, causing two later argv tests to hit `_log_filesystem_is_target` fail-closed on macOS (no `/proc/self/mountinfo` → `not is_preview_env()` → True). On Linux hosted gate the same tests passed because mountinfo existed and `/tmp` was not on `/dev/vda`. Fix: test now does `monkeypatch.setenv` for all popped keys so teardown restores (this changeset). No safety relaxation.

**BF-003 — 800×600 and 1280×720 are supported short layouts**
The window minimum is 800×600. 1280×720 uses compact pads and a scrolling body so footer actions stay on-window. Pick-list overflow still scrolls with `yview` restore.

**BF-004 — HiDPI not gated**
`xvfb-run @72 DPI` is the only automated gate. At 144 DPI, `WRAP` labels and `_Box` halo may clip. No failure seen in gallery/tk at 72 DPI. Follow-up: add a separate 144 DPI smoke on the hosted gate (not required for 1.0).

**BF-005 — Earlier Secure Boot expectation superseded (#119)**
The earlier unsigned-image assumption does not describe the inspected Q12 bytes. The current builder explicitly uses `--uefi-secure-boot enable`; the shipped x64 path is Microsoft-signed Debian shim, Debian-signed GRUB, then Debian-signed kernel. [Artifact inspection and the physical cases](secure-boot-acceptance.md) replace the enrollment-based verdict. Existing release assets and earlier execution logs remain historical; no universal acceptance or firmware-change workaround is authorized.

**BF-006 — eMMC only machines show empty pick**
Machines whose only non-boot storage is `mmcblk0` with only eMMC (laptops/tablets) correctly show a single selectable `mmcblk0` (ST-09). If that machine exposes only `mmcblk0boot0` (firmware area) the list is empty → `PICK_EMPTY` with "plug in the drive you want to erase" — honest but not ergonomic for eMMC-only recycle. Follow-up: keep as supported with `PICK_EMPTY`; do not auto-promote `mmcblk0boot0` to a target.

**BF-007 — USB-SATA bridges may present as `tran sata`**
A USB stick behind a SATA bridge reports `tran sata` not `usb`, so label scan alone (`_looks_like_live_medium`) would treat it as non-live-medium and fail closed (BM-05). Live mounts still identify it correctly. Follow-up: no code change required — mount path is ground truth; label fallback staying narrow is the correct fail-closed trade.

**BF-008 — Manufacturing ISO version vs `dist` artifact**
`dist/beamo-wipe-0.1.0-amd64.iso` (8a531d…) is the last manufacturing ISO from commit `3b4c01f`. Code is 0.1.1 with fail-closed patches. Until `beamo-wipe-0.1.1-amd64.iso` is built on Cloud Build, the release asset lags code. Follow-up: trigger `scripts/ci-cloud.sh --project beamo-wipe` and upload new ISO to GitHub Releases (separate operator authorization required; not done in this matrix change).

**BF-009 — QEMU destructive evidence not refreshed on this host**
Disposable `qcow2` wipe against `beamo-wipe-0.1.1` not re-run on the Apple silicon host (TCG only). Previous QEMU checklist in `docs/vm-test.md` still applies. Follow-up: operator to run `docs/vm-test.md` on an x86_64 KVM VM (steps in section 4) and paste the `sha256sum`, firmware mode, and wizard screenshots into the release checklist.

**BF-010 — `Wizard.confirm_erase` rediscover crash on `CalledProcessError`/`TimeoutExpired` (MEDIUM, wizard)**
Evidence: `BEAMO_WIPE_DRY_RUN=1` dry_run=False wizard at `LAST_CHANCE` with `rediscover=lambda: raise CalledProcessError(1,'lsblk')` or `TimeoutExpired('lsblk',15)` → pre-fix `confirm_erase` raised uncaught traceback; `OSError`/`ValueError` were already handled. Repro: `BEAMO_WIPE_DRY_RUN=1 python3 - <<'PY'` drive to `LAST_CHANCE` (`skip_splash`→`accept_what`→`set_owner True`→`select_disk`→`continue_pick`→`set_confirm_input token`→`continue_confirm`→`continue_method`, `_erase_until=0`) then `confirm_erase()` with throwing rediscover. Affected: `src/beamo_wipe/wizard.py:309-313`, staged `packaging/live/.../wizard.py`. Fix: widen except to `OSError, ValueError, CalledProcessError, TimeoutExpired, JSONDecodeError, TypeError, AttributeError` + final `Exception` → `self.error="Could not re-read disks: …"` fail-closed, `LAST_CHANCE`, `runner.start` not called. Severity: Medium (live USB only; no destructive target exposed, but UX was a traceback instead of a refusal). Acceptance: throwing rediscover yields `LAST_CHANCE` with `Could not re-read disks` and `started==False`; `python3 -m pytest tests/test_wizard_flow.py tests/test_confirmation_gates.py -q` green. Status: **Fixed in this audit** (`docs/audit-2026-09-02.md` §3).

**BF-011 — `THIRD_PARTY.md` fallback claim contradicts fail-closed nwipe build (LOW, docs)**
Evidence: `THIRD_PARTY.md:16-18` pre-fix: “If build cannot clone GitHub, it may fall back to Debian `nwipe` package …” Hook `packaging/live/config/hooks/normal/0500-build-nwipe.hook.chroot:2` says “No distro fallback — bookworm's nwipe is not 0.42” and after 5 retries `exit 1` (`ERROR: git clone nwipe failed`). No `apt-get install nwipe` exists (pinned by `tests/test_live_image.py::test_nwipe_hook_fails_closed_instead_of_unpinned_fallback`). Affected: `THIRD_PARTY.md`. Root: doc not updated when build hardened to pinned commit `6082bde060091e66365d852a1877f2ee80c67105`. Fix: doc now says pinned tag+commit, 5 retries then fail, no Debian fallback, hook `NWIPE_VERSION` check. Severity: Low (operator confusion, not safety bypass). Acceptance: `THIRD_PARTY.md` states no fallback, 5 retries, `grep -q "apt-get install.*nwipe" packaging/live/config/hooks/normal/0500-build-nwipe.hook.chroot` → 0 hits, `grep -q "No distro fallback" …` → hit. Status: **Fixed in this audit**.

**BF-012 — CI lint gate non-blocking (`|| true`) — 27 remaining `ruff` lints do not gate PRs (LOW, CI)**
Evidence: `.github/workflows/ci.yml:22-31` `lint` job: `python -m ruff check src/beamo_wipe tests || true`, `python -m mypy … || true`. `python3 -m ruff check src/beamo_wipe tests` without `|| true` reports 31 errors (e.g., `tests/test_boot_exclusion_fails_closed.py:24 F401 parse_lsblk_json`, `tests/test_confirmation_gates.py:18 F401 os`); 4 were fixed in this audit, 27 remain (F401 in test helpers, E402 top-level import after `pytest.importorskip`, F841 unused locals). Affected: `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, `tests/*.py`. Root: lint intentionally informational to avoid blocking style nits. Follow-up: make `ruff check` blocking and keep `mypy` informational, or add a dedicated blocking `safety-lint` job; track hygiene in a follow-up `style:` commit (do not collapse into this `safety:` audit). Severity: Low (tests still gate; no safety relaxation). Acceptance: either the lint step removes `|| true` from `ruff` or `docs/ci.md` explicitly documents non-blocking as intentional with rationale; `python3 -m ruff check tests/test_boot_exclusion_fails_closed.py tests/test_compatibility_matrix.py` ≤5 errors (this audit’s worst file fixed). Status: **Backlog** (tracked, not fixed in this audit). Note: CI has since migrated from `.github/workflows/ci.yml` to `cloudbuild.yaml` + `scripts/ci-hosted.sh run_lint`; the non-blocking policy is unchanged.

**BF-013 — Sidecar bare filename (`beamo-wipe-*.iso.sha256` = `hash  filename` without `dist/` prefix) needs `cd dist` for verification (LOW, release)**
Evidence: `dist/beamo-wipe-0.1.0-amd64.iso.sha256` = `8a531…  beamo-wipe-0.1.0-amd64.iso` (bare). `sha256sum -c dist/beamo-wipe-0.1.0-amd64.iso.sha256` from repo root → `No such file or directory` (looks in cwd); `(cd dist && sha256sum -c SHA256SUMS)` succeeds (as do `(cd dist && sha256sum -c beamo-wipe-0.1.0-amd64.iso.sha256)` and `sha256sum dist/beamo-wipe-0.1.0-amd64.iso`). `docs/release-verification.md` already documents both forms; `scripts/generate-release-manifest.sh` uses `cd dist` for verify. Affected: `dist/*.sha256` format (intentional), `docs/release-verification.md:26`, `README.md` flash example. Root: `sha256sum file > file.sha256` writes bare name (correct for `cd dist` use); repo-root `sha256sum -c dist/...` needs `dist/` prefix. Fix: doc clarification only, no sidecar format change. Severity: Low (consumer confusion, not safety; manifest `_manifest_sha256` via `verify_manifest` still works). Acceptance: `docs/release-verification.md` shows both `(cd dist && sha256sum -c SHA256SUMS)` and `sha256sum dist/beamo-wipe-*.iso` forms; `scripts/generate-release-manifest.sh` verifies with `cd dist` (already). Status: **Backlog** (docs only, no code change in this audit; `docs/audit-2026-09-02.md` §10 records both).

## 13. Evidence & logs (this checkout)

- `python3 -m pytest -k "not tk_runtime"` — **218 passed, 0 failed** on `Darwin arm64` with `BEAMO_WIPE_DRY_RUN=1` (historical snapshot from the 0.1.1 matrix release, kept for provenance; for current counts see the hosted gate per `docs/ci.md`). Hosted gate re-runs the same under `xvfb-run 72 DPI` on `x86_64`.
- Tk clipped-text / off-window probes: 14 layout tests + 12 keyboard/scroll tests. On this Mac, Tk `Aborted` in headless `DISPLAY=:1` @96 DPI is pre-existing and not the gate; hosted gate uses `DISPLAY=:99` @72 DPI.
- `BEAMO_WIPE_NO_OPEN=1 ./preview --web` → `web-preview/index.html` (gallery) and `BEAMO_WIPE_DEMO=1 ./preview --console </dev/null` both exit 0; no real disks enumerated.
- No `nwipe` subprocess was spawned in any fake-device test — spy: `NwipeRunner.start` raises `SafetyError("Refusing to exec nwipe in preview or dry-run.")`; `DryRunRunner` fakes `WipeResult`; `subprocess.Popen` spy in `test_popen_inherits_wipe_lock_fd` asserts `pass_fds`, `cwd="/"`, `shell False`, `start_new_session True`.
- `git diff` safety review: `src/beamo_wipe/__init__.py` → staged sync, `tests/test_security_hardening.py` env fix, new `tests/fixtures/*.json` + `tests/test_compatibility_matrix.py`, this matrix doc. No relaxation of `safety.py`/`nwipe_runner.py`/`discover.py` gates.

## 14. Remaining risks & unsupported hardware (honest)

- **APFS / BitLocker / SED / OPAL** — wizard does not unlock encrypted volumes; they appear as raw block devices if unlocked at firmware, otherwise not listed via `mountpoint` protected checks. No BitLocker extraction. See `docs/storage-and-controller-limits.md` §4 for per-state guidance.
- **NVMe Secure Erase / ATA Secure Erase** — not implemented; wrapper only calls `nwipe`. Documented as not a sanitizer bypass. For certified erasure use vendor tools per `docs/storage-and-controller-limits.md` §5.
- **RAID / Intel RST / mdadm / LVM** — may expose `dm-0`/`md127` or hide members; not supported, not listed, not claimed.
- **USB-C / Thunderbolt docks** — additional hubs not enumerated in `docs/boot-card.md`.
- **Serial over non-standard encoding** — `udev` `\xHH` decoding covers typical, but exotic USB hub serials may still fall back to device name (still safe via `SAFE_TOKEN_RE`).
- **Concurrent `nwipe` lock** — `pinned_nwipe_already_running` checks `/proc/*/exe` and refuses on an unreadable process list or permission failure. Exited processes and kernel threads without an executable are ignored; preview cannot invoke the real engine.

## 15. Changelog

| Version | Date | Beamo Wipe | Change |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **1.0** | 2026-09-01 | 0.1.1 | Initial publish: firmware/BIOS/UEFI, USB, NVMe/SATA/multi, missing/duplicate, unusual controllers, resolutions, keyboard, boot-media, safety gates, supported/degraded/unsupported, BF-001..009 |
| **1.1** | 2026-09-02 | 0.1.1 | First complete audit: wizard (`BF-010` rediscover crash fix), docs (`BF-011` no-fallback), CI (`BF-012` ruff non-blocking), release (`BF-013` sidecar `cd dist`); full evidence in `docs/audit-2026-09-02.md` |
| **1.2** | 2026-09-03 | 0.2.1 | Security audit hardening: device identity rechecks, metadata sanitization, private files, verified provenance, fixed kiosk boundary, content-addressed CI, isolated shipped-engine QEMU, and explicit no-overwrite publication gate. |
| **1.4** | 2026-09-05 | 0.2.2 | Startup diagnostic reporting separated from wipe evidence; support runbook 1.1 defines privacy and blocked-export handling. Build and hardware validation remain required. |
| **1.3** | 2026-09-05 | 0.2.2 | Canonical method and evidence wording, explicit storage limits, excluded inventory, fresh authorization, and the GTK screen-reader view. |
| **1.5** | 2026-09-05 | 0.2.3 | Same-boot evidence recovery and bounded evidence-save retries; erase outcome and persistence remain separate. Firmware and device support are unchanged. |
| **1.6** | 2026-09-06 | 0.2.4 | Remove unused private callback state; preserve picker visibility during layout changes and cancel callbacks before redraw or shutdown. Disk safety and hardware support are unchanged. |
| **1.7** | 2026-09-06 | 0.2.6 | Recover from runner status, report export, and storage I/O failures; preserve valid state across short reads and close resources reliably. Existing disk safety and hardware support remain unchanged. |
| **1.8** | 2026-09-09 | 0.2.7 | Fail closed on leftover USB label fallback and mounted RAID/multipath members; decimal GB labels use half-up rounding; Tk Enter follows the focused control. |
| **1.9** | 2026-09-13 | 0.2.8 | First signed release, speech boot entries, and full three-method qualification; physical-hardware limits remain. |
| **1.10** | 2026-09-13 | 0.2.9 | Bounded kiosk recovery and portable developer tooling. Exact qualification is recorded in the release manifest; hardware support is unchanged. |
| **1.11** | 2026-09-25 | 0.2.10 | Safety, recovery, desktop media, release packaging, and verification fixes from the comprehensive audit. Hardware support and pinned nwipe remain unchanged. |
| **1.12** | 2026-09-27 | 0.2.11 | Blacksmith release target and signed publication workflow; exact qualification belongs in the eventual release manifest. Physical hardware support and pinned nwipe remain unchanged. |
| **1.13** | 2026-09-28 | 0.2.12 | Kiosk terminal EOF and persistent input-failure recovery, uncertain-cleanup support wording, and draft asset verification; pending exact-source qualification. Hardware support and pinned nwipe remain unchanged. |
| **1.14** | 2026-09-29 | 0.2.12 | Development/doctor and CI guidance corrected to the configured Blacksmith route; runbook 1.12 separates local subsets, main qualification and authorized publication. Legacy tooling retained. No hosted run triggered for this correction. |
