# Controlled QEMU destructive-path verification

Run `scripts/qemu-verify.sh` only on an isolated x86_64 Linux worker with no host-disk passthrough. It aborts on macOS, non-x86_64 hosts, a missing exact-version ISO/manifest, unverifiable checksums, or any uncertain loop identity.

## Isolation and inputs

- Every run gets a mode-0700 `mktemp` directory under `/tmp`; no predictable target, mount, PID, or evidence path is reused.
- The report-export check creates a disposable FAT32 raw image per method
  inside the isolated x86_64 worker. The BIOS guest boots the exact ISO twice
  for each of Everyday, Extra, and Quick zero. Each journey uses its own 64 MiB
  qcow2 target and report image. QMP drives owner approval, target
  selection, confirmation, the production method key, and Done, then
  hotplugs that method's report image. Method flags are not weakened for
  speed. The gate waits for `BEAMO_WIPE_REPORT_SAVED`.
- After QEMU exits, the host reattaches the report image read-only, requires a
  clean FAT32 filesystem, mounts it read-only, and independently checks the
  completion manifest, every listed SHA-256, the result sidecar, the terminal
  successful outcome, and final unmount. The on-media manifest is required to
  describe content only and to set `safe_to_remove` false; only the live
  `BEAMO_WIPE_REPORT_SAVED` marker proves the worker verified and unmounted the
  USB. A separate killed private-namespace helper must leave no host-namespace
  mount behind.
- The script accepts only `dist/beamo-wipe-<version>-amd64.iso` and its matching manifest/sidecars. There is no wildcard ISO, distro `nwipe`, host `nwipe`, or apt fallback.
- Speech boot probes press the shipped S hotkey. BIOS then presses Return to
  launch the selected entry; GRUB's UEFI hotkey launches immediately, so its
  probe sends no Return that could boot the default during menu startup. A
  timeout prints only fixed, allowlisted marker counts.
- QEMU initially receives only the read-only ISO and a newly created qcow2
  target. The report is a newly created raw file hotplugged through QMP as USB
  storage after Done. QEMU receives no `/dev` bind, host block disk, or network
  interface.
- The direct engine boundary uses a newly created 64 MiB raw file per
  production method and repetition. Every host loop is re-proved by exact backing file,
  `lsblk TYPE=loop`, read-only state, and `findmnt` before use and detachment.
- The worker installs `hdparm` because exact nwipe v0.42 exits before device processing when it is absent. The Beamo application does not invoke `hdparm`, and no destructive hdparm option is used by this gate.
- Signal handlers stop after one idempotent cleanup and exit nonzero. Cleanup
  kills only PIDs obtained from the current background QEMU commands, detaches
  only loops still proven to have the expected backing/type/read-only state,
  unmounts private mounts, and removes disposable images. Evidence remains in
  the path recorded by `qemu-evidence/PATH` for the CI collector.

## Required checks

The gate fails unless all of these pass:

1. ISO and manifest sidecars, manifest-to-actual-ISO hash/size/path binding, ISO9660 PVD, and El Torito catalog.
2. Read-only mount of the ISO and squashfs, exact `nwipe version 0.42`, root ownership, and no group/other-writable kiosk/engine assets. The BIOS (`isolinux/live.cfg`) and UEFI (`boot/grub/grub.cfg`) menus show the branded Beamo Wipe entries, keep the troubleshooting entry, state that booting erases nothing, and contain no stock Debian entry.
3. No unnecessary admin tools (`nano`, `less`, `iproute2`, `dmidecode`, PCI/USB utilities, `eject`) or compiler/VCS in the installed package database. `hdparm` remains only because pinned nwipe v0.42 uses its read-only HPA/DCO queries.
4. `debsecan --suite bookworm --only-fixed` reports no installed package with a fixed Debian vulnerability.
5. Fake-disk owner, confirmation, countdown, boot-exclusion, rediscovery, and process-boundary tests.
6. The binary copied byte-for-byte from the ISO completes Everyday (`prng` +
   last-pass verify), Extra (`dodshort` + last-pass verify), and Quick zero
   (`zero`, verify off) on separate disposable loops with explicit timeouts,
   ordered write/verify phase logs, success markers, and overwrite proofs twice
   per method, and rejects
   a non-block target.
7. SeaBIOS runs two independent Wizard journeys for each method, hotplugs that
   method's FAT32 report file, and reaches the shipped report-saved marker.
   After the guest stops, a successful `qemu-img convert` reads the entire
   target into a private raw file. The host requires the expected size, checks
   every sector against the 0xa5 prefill (every byte zero for Quick zero),
   records its hash, and deletes the temporary readback. Read errors fail.
   The host then checks `result.json` method and source/build identity fields,
   RESULT.txt wording, the completion manifest, and checksums. Missing/error
   markers, unchanged target bytes, or early exit fail. The receipt records
   ISO/nwipe hashes, source commit, build identity, and executed repetitions.
8. OVMF reaches the shipped Tk `OWNER` marker. Missing OVMF, an early exit, or a
   timeout is a failure, never `SKIP` or a tolerated timeout.

```sh
BEAMO_WIPE_VERSION=0.2.12 ./scripts/qemu-verify.sh
evidence_dir=$(cat qemu-evidence/PATH)
find "$evidence_dir" -maxdepth 1 -type f -print
```

The run does not validate physical SATA/NVMe firmware behavior, USB bridges, Secure Boot, RAID, SSD spare-area erasure, or a human click-through of every graphical screen. Those require separately authorized lab hardware and are not claimed.
