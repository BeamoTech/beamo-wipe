# VM integration test notes

Use **throwaway virtual disks only**.

Do not treat this Apple silicon Mac as the ISO/QEMU gate. Docker `linux/amd64`
and `qemu-system-x86_64` here are TCG. The hosted ISO build is Google Cloud
Build: `./scripts/ci-cloud.sh` (project `beamo-wipe`). Interactive QEMU wipe
below uses an **x86_64 Linux VM** via `gcloud`/`aws`; prefer KVM when
project policy permits it. If hardware acceleration is prohibited, preserve that
policy and use bounded x64 TCG runs with the accelerator recorded in evidence.
Copy hashes out and delete the VM. Pytest and `./preview` stay local.

## Demo (no ISO)

```bash
python3 -m pytest
./preview
./preview --web
```

Keyboard-only can finish `./preview --console`.

## ISO in QEMU (x86_64)

Build:

```bash
./scripts/build-iso.sh
```

Two disks: the ISO (live) and a 10G target.

```bash
qemu-img create -f qcow2 /tmp/beamo-wipe-target.qcow2 10G
qemu-system-x86_64 -m 2048 \
  -cdrom dist/beamo-wipe-0.2.11-amd64.iso \
  -drive file=/tmp/beamo-wipe-target.qcow2,if=virtio,format=qcow2 \
  -boot order=d
```

Checklist:

- [ ] ISO boots UEFI (pflash code+vars drives; `-bios OVMF_CODE.fd` only when no vars template exists).
- [ ] ISO boots legacy BIOS (default SeaBIOS).
- [ ] Wizard is the first and only UI (no desktop, no raw nwipe).
- [ ] Keyboard-only can complete the flow.
- [ ] The 10G disk appears with size + serial (QEMU may show a short serial).
- [ ] The live disc is not selectable.
- [ ] Wrong confirm token keeps Choose erase method disabled.
- [ ] Everyday wipe on the 10G disk completes; success screen.
- [ ] Killing nwipe (or `--fail-demo` in demo) shows failure, not success.
- [ ] `helper/index.html` opens in a browser and is obviously not a wiper.

## Hardware lab (optional, owner disks only)

Label the target “DISPOSABLE”. One Intel/AMD UEFI PC with a SATA HDD. One NVMe
SSD if you want to note SSD limits in a report. Do not claim Apple Silicon.

## Reusable USB driver and hotplug matrix

See [the USB simulation lab](../tools/usb_lab/README.md) for EHCI/xHCI, bulk
storage/UAS, insertion/removal, read-only media, fault injection, native Linux
and Windows probes, packet captures, and guarded cloud teardown. This adds
transport and failure-path coverage alongside the boot/erase gate above.
