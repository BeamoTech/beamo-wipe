# Beamo Wipe

For development on Windows, macOS, or Linux, start with the [development guide](docs/development.md) and `python3 dev.py doctor` (`py -3 dev.py doctor` on Windows).

A guided USB for **nwipe**.

Beamo Wipe is a bootable x86_64 live USB UI that walks a first-time BIOS user
through erasing a disk they own. You pay for a flashed stick, a boot-key card,
and this wizard. You do not pay for a secret wipe algorithm.

> Owner-operated sanitization before recycle or resale. Not a lab certificate.

## Desktop entry (development)

The Windows and Linux launchers provide a local readiness check. Linux can
offer an explicit **Restart into Beamo Wipe** action when firmware exposes an
exact USB boot entry. Windows gives boot-menu instructions and leaves restart
and firmware settings to the owner. The launchers never erase a disk.
Booting the USB normally remains available.
A separate FAT32 `.img` is intended for the desktop-readable USB layout; the
`.iso` remains available for conventional booting.

This is an implementation under validation, not a new universal compatibility
claim. Both system and separate-drive erasure still require the offline live
environment. Opening the application and approving permissions are explicit;
Windows publisher warnings and Linux execution policies still apply. See
[desktop design and evidence limits](docs/desktop-entry-design.md).

To preview the new desktop launcher with Go installed, run
`go run . --preview` from the `desktop/` directory. This opens the local browser
interface with simulated readiness; its restart button does not restart the
computer or erase anything.

## See the UI on this computer

Nothing is erased. Fake disks only. This is the way to look at the screens
without building an ISO or booting a USB.

```bash
cd "/path/to/Beamo Wipe"   # this repo
./preview                   # real Tk window (same screens as the live USB)
./preview --web             # browser click-through of the same copy
./preview --helper          # boot-menu helper page (does not wipe)
./preview --empty           # no other disks
./preview --blocked         # cannot identify the USB
./preview --fail            # finished screen after a failed wipe
./preview --accessible      # Linux GTK view for Orca / AT-SPI
./preview --console         # keyboard screens in the terminal
./preview --plain-console   # sequential text prompts, without screen redraws
```

`make preview` and `make preview-web` are the same commands.

The native windows are the real app. The browser page is a click-through so you can
see the flow in Safari or Chrome without installing anything extra.

If `./preview` cannot open a window (no Tk), it falls back to `--console`.

On the live USB, the boot menu also offers a speech entry — press **S** when
the menu appears (see [screen-reader operation](docs/screen-reader.md)).
Inside the guide, press **F8** before erasure to open the screen-reader view
with Orca. Switching views clears all previous confirmations and checks disks
again. Use Tab and Shift+Tab to move, Space to activate controls, and the
standard Orca reading commands for text. See [screen-reader operation](docs/screen-reader.md).

On the disk list, choose **I'm not sure which disk** for identification help,
including external disks and disks from another computer. Help clears the
selected disk and its confirmation. Back returns with nothing selected; your
existing ownership acknowledgement is retained. **Stop and shut down** lets
you stop before checking labels or connections. The console offers **U** for
help, **Esc** to return and **S** to stop; the plain text fallback asks for
`BACK` or `STOP`. Preview closes or shows a close-tab message instead of
powering off this computer.

Before erasure, **Check disks again** (F5, or `CHECK DISKS AGAIN` at a text
prompt) first explains that it clears the selected disk, ownership
acknowledgement, typed confirmation, method, and countdown, and that
preparation starts again from the beginning. You can keep your answers, or
continue. Then it reads the inventory again and identifies the boot device
again. Complete the entire confirmation flow again. A failed refresh leaves
no stale target selectable. Refresh is unavailable once an erase is starting
or running.

The disk list opens with a short count such as **2 disks available to erase · Beamo USB protected**, so you can check that the expected disks were found.
Zero, one, and several disks use ordinary English plurals. Other devices that
cannot be erased are counted separately. If the list cannot be confirmed, the
count says so and no disk is offered.

**Beamo USB — protected, cannot be erased** appears separately above the disks
you can choose, with its name, size and **Serial number** or hardware ID. The keyboard
console shows its protected status; press B to read its full identity. If the
boot device cannot be identified, no protected card or erase targets are shown.

**Other detected devices** is information only: each row explains why the
device cannot be selected. In the keyboard console, press O to read and scroll
these explanations. No excluded row offers an erase action or bypass.

Results use the same evidence-based explanation in the native interfaces and report
exports. “Erase completed; verification passed” requires validated completion
evidence for a method with read-back verification. Quick zero instead says
“Erase completed; verification was not performed.” Read-back checks exposed
storage only; it does not prove hidden copies were erased. Confirmed user
cancellation says “Stopped by you.” Failed verification, interruption, missing
evidence, and an unconfirmed stop remain distinct. Saved evidence can be checked
for its result without resuming erasure; missing or inconsistent evidence never
becomes success.

## What this is not

- Not for **Apple Silicon** Macs, Chromebooks, Android, or RAID controllers.
- Not a wipe from inside Windows or macOS. The PC must boot this USB.
- Intel Mac USB boot-picker guidance is best-effort only; it is not Mac wipe support.
- Not DoD / NSA / NIST “certified.” Not a Blancco replacement.
- Not a new wipe engine. The only eraser is [nwipe](https://github.com/martijnvanbrummelen/nwipe) **v0.42**.
- Opening the application is explicit. The firmware boot menu (often F12,
  Esc, or F9) remains necessary when guided restart is unavailable.

Listing language we are allowed to use: [docs/claims.md](docs/claims.md).
Controller and erase limits: [docs/storage-and-controller-limits.md](docs/storage-and-controller-limits.md)
(SSD wear-leveling, hidden areas, encryption, RAID, when vendor tools or destruction are required).

## License

This wrapper is **GPL-3.0-or-later**. nwipe is **GPL-2.0**. We run nwipe as a
separate program. Source: this repository. There is **no warranty**.

## Build the ISO

Use Blacksmith (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) for the amd64 ISO gate.
A local build needs Docker on an isolated x86_64 Linux worker. Apple Silicon
emulation is not the ISO or QEMU verification gate.

```bash
./scripts/build-iso.sh
```

The ISO lands in `dist/beamo-wipe-0.2.10-amd64.iso`. If Docker or live-build
packages are missing, the script prints the missing pieces and exits non-zero.

`make iso` is the same command.

## Run the wizard in a VM

**Preview on your Mac/PC (fake disks, no wipe):**

```bash
./preview
./preview --web
```

**QEMU, after you have an ISO** (throws away a 10G virtual disk):

```bash
qemu-img create -f qcow2 /tmp/beamo-wipe-target.qcow2 10G
qemu-system-x86_64 -m 2048 -enable-kvm \
  -cdrom dist/beamo-wipe-0.2.10-amd64.iso \
  -drive file=/tmp/beamo-wipe-target.qcow2,if=virtio,format=qcow2 \
  -boot d
```

Run these boot/erase checks on an isolated x86_64 Linux worker with disposable
virtual disks and no host-disk passthrough. macOS development uses `./preview`;
Apple Silicon cannot accelerate this x86_64 guest with HVF. See
[the VM verification policy](docs/vm-test.md).

UEFI:

```bash
# OVMF 4M firmware does not load via -bios ("could not load PC BIOS"):
# attach code (readonly) plus a writable vars copy as pflash drives.
cp /usr/share/OVMF/OVMF_VARS.fd /tmp/beamo-ovmf-vars.fd
qemu-system-x86_64 -m 2048 \
  -drive if=pflash,format=raw,readonly=on,file=/usr/share/OVMF/OVMF_CODE.fd \
  -drive if=pflash,format=raw,file=/tmp/beamo-ovmf-vars.fd \
  -cdrom dist/beamo-wipe-0.2.10-amd64.iso \
  -drive file=/tmp/beamo-wipe-target.qcow2,if=virtio,format=qcow2
# No vars template (older OVMF_CODE.fd-only layout): -bios /usr/share/OVMF/OVMF_CODE.fd
```

Full notes: [docs/vm-test.md](docs/vm-test.md).

Use **only disposable virtual disks**. Never point this at a developer machine’s
real Windows disk.

## Flash a USB for testing

```bash
# Linux (double-check the device name)
sudo dd if=dist/beamo-wipe-0.2.10-amd64.iso of=/dev/sdX bs=4M status=progress conv=fsync

# Or Raspberry Pi Imager / balenaEtcher: pick the ISO, pick the USB, flash.
```

The separate desktop-readable `.img` is 2 GiB with one active FAT32 partition
containing the launchers, live files, README, and licenses. Use that verified
image for desktop-entry testing; flashing the ISO does not establish Windows
launcher-file visibility.

## Unit tests

```bash
python3 -m pytest
# or
make test
# or
./scripts/test-all.sh
```

Tests use fake `lsblk` JSON. They never run nwipe on a real disk.

Hosted CI — lint, x86_64 pytest, preview, negative test, the amd64 ISO
build, and controlled QEMU verification — runs on Blacksmith through
GitHub Actions (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`, required check `CI gate`). Details: [docs/ci.md](docs/ci.md).

## How it works

1. Boot the live USB (UEFI or legacy BIOS, x86_64).
2. The wizard is the first screen. There is no desktop and no raw nwipe TUI.
3. Confirm ownership or permission to erase. Identify the intended disk by
   model, size, and serial. If unsure, open the identification help.
   For same-size disks, square brackets mark the serial portion to compare
   when a comparison is available. A text note also gives its character
   positions. Always check the full ID and follow the confirmation prompt.
   Duplicate or missing serials are not highlighted. With multiple disks, open
   **Compare disks** to read their identities side by side (stacked on narrow
   screens). Reading the comparison does not change your selection. In the
   screen-reader view, expand **Compare disks**; in the console, press **C**,
   then **Esc** to return. The plain console prints the same comparison before
   the disk choices. If identity is uncertain, shut down and disconnect the
   extra drives.
4. The Beamo USB cannot be selected. If we cannot tell which disk is the USB,
   the app refuses to list disks.
5. Type-to-confirm, five-second delay, then nwipe runs non-interactively.
6. The final screen reports success, failure, or interruption. Success requires
   exit 0 and positive completion evidence for the selected target, with no
   failure markers. Everyday and Three overwrites include a separate read-back
   verification pass; Quick zero does not perform verification.
   Read-back checks exposed storage only and does not prove that hidden copies
   were erased. Additional overwrite passes do not fix SSD coverage limitations
   ([details](docs/storage-and-controller-limits.md#3-overwrite-limits--why-overwrite-alone-is-not-a-certificate)).
   Reports are not a formal certificate. If required assurance cannot be
   established, consult the drive maker's guidance for the exact model and
   firmware or use a qualified destruction service.

## Development

```bash
./preview                      # Tk wizard, fake disks
./preview --web                # browser click-through
python3 -m beamo_wipe --demo   # same as ./preview
```

Cursor Cloud Agents boot from `.cursor/environment.json` (`install.sh` / `start.sh`); `.cursor/check.sh` is the smoke.

Default everyday method is nwipe `prng`, one round, verify last, no blank pass.
Details: [docs/ADVANCED.md](docs/ADVANCED.md).

### macOS preview runtime

The desktop `./preview` launcher prefers an installed modern Python/Tk on macOS.
Python 3.10.0 with Tk 8.6.11 can abort when closing a native window. Python
3.14.7 with Tk 9.0.4 was verified to close cleanly. An explicit runtime can be
selected with `BEAMO_WIPE_PREVIEW_PYTHON=python3.14 ./preview`. This affects only
the fake-device desktop preview, not the live Linux launcher. Automatic selection
falls back to the keyboard preview if no usable Tk 8.6.13 or newer is found.
Console, web, helper, help, and version modes do not open Tk probe windows.

At method selection, **Storage limits (L)** opens the supported limits offline.
The warning includes inaccessible, remapped, over-provisioned, and controller-managed
flash areas and explains why additional overwrite passes do not fix those limits.
See [the full limits](docs/storage-and-controller-limits.md).

When a wipe cannot start, use the separately labeled [diagnostic report](docs/startup-diagnostics.md) path. Diagnostic reports are not erase evidence.

### Erasing another disk

After an erase has stopped, choose **Erase another disk** on the result screen.
Save the current report first, or choose **Continue without saving** when asked.
**Keep session open** returns to the report. Remove the report USB before
starting the new session; insert it again only when the next result offers report
saving. A new session checks the disks again
and requires ownership, disk selection, typed confirmation, method selection
and the full five-second wait. Nothing starts automatically. Keep the Beamo USB
connected; shut down before disconnecting disks.

Console: type `ANOTHER` (or press `A` in the keyboard interface). See
[session safety and verification](docs/evidence/erase-another-103/README.md).

### Planning to save a report

Open **Need a report?** before choosing an erase target (also available at method
selection and in Advanced). Keep a separate supported FAT32 report USB unplugged
until the erase has stopped and Save report to USB is offered; then insert it
before choosing Save. Keep the boot USB and erase disk connected. Any unsaved
report is lost on live-session shutdown or power loss. The optional preference
records intent for this session. It does not save anything. If a report was requested
and no verified export completed, shutdown asks **Shut down without saving?**
with **Keep session open** as the safe default. See [shutdown protection](docs/report-shutdown.md).
See [the exact media, refresh and safe-removal requirements](docs/ADVANCED.md#logs).
